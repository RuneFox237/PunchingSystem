# PunchingSystem
A System for VRChat Avatars that allows other people to punch you and make you ragdoll.

To get the latest version pick it up from Gumroad(insert link when ready) or the Releases section to the left ->

***NOTE: You must own [VRLab's Ragdoll System](https://github.com/VRLabs/Ragdoll-System) to use this as it builds off of the stuff generated by that.***

For instructions on how to install the system, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/RuneFox237/PunchingSystem/wiki)
